# code-refractor
Horiseon is a company that needs it's website renovated to become optimized for search engines and to meet accesibility standards. Here are some of the following changes I have made. 
Removed the div class code for the image of the board meeting and I replaced it with a figure command.
In the body section I changed this part that was a div to a section because it made more sense.
I changed the multiple benefit classes into one combined class because they all had the same attributes. I also had to change the css to fit and deleted the other two classes.
I took out the periods in front of the header code in CSS.
I reduced all the benefit code because they repeated often.
I reduced the search engine, online reputation, social media classes that were redundant and had to correct them into the html.
